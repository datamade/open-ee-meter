Open EE Meter
========
Data analysis & visualization of energy savings projects, to ultimately empower utilities and contractors to improve the efficacy of energy savings programs. An open-source project, based upon transparent data standards.

### Project Background

The current state-of-the-art in energy program evaluation is far from ideal, hindered by a lack of feedback loops and misaligned interests. Implementers, utilities, regulators, and contractors are delayed for years without standard and readily accessible calculations of realized savings, restricting their ability to make strategic changes to energy savings programs.

The absence of timely evaluation prevents ongoing comparisons of various programs, implementers, contractors, and utilities, which would otherwise foster healthy competition and benchmarking. These problems exist in spite of increasingly ubiquitous analytics resources, such as interval metering and readily available weather normalization. The Open EE Meter dashboard helps alleviate these problems, by creating a trusted and transparent system to measure and provide near real time feedback on energy savings.
